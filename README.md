Heads up: this repo is currently a work in progress.

Imagine an evening news cast personalized to your interests...

This application is an experiment with news aggregation and summarization. The goal is to replicate the experience of a newscaster or news team aggregating the most important news items related to a subject (e.g. world news or NASA) and aggregating them into a summary of summaries. 

It is a news feed web app and backend built with React and Flask. 

To run: 
Go to ./api/ and pipenv install, then run FLASK_APP=news_server.py then flask run. You will need API keys for NewsAPI, BING and SMMRY.
